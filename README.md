**Overview**  
Cub3D is a 3D raycasting engine born from the 42/1337 curriculum, inspired by classic titles like Wolfenstein 3D. My objective: build a **lightweight yet extremely performant engine** using only the tools permitted, pushing beyond expectations with optimized rendering, smart algorithms and a clean engine API.  

**Mandatory Features**  
In the core engine I implemented:  
- A DDA‑based raycasting algorithm for wall collision and rendering.  
- Angle correction and distance reuse to eliminate distortion and reduce computation.  
- Map parsing with gap‑filling (spaces) to avoid invalid map configurations; automatic map validation.  
- Optimized scene drawing: sky, floor and walls are redrawn only when necessary—reducing CPU load and boosting FPS.  

**Bonus Features**  
Going beyond the base requirements, this project also includes:  
- A fully functional **start menu** with clickable buttons (Start, Exit, Controls) and mouse interaction.  
- A custom **video player** module built with libav/avcodec and OpenSSL, enabling playback of remote HTTPS video URLs integrated with in‑game events.  
- **Interactive doors** governed by precise mathematical equations, integrated into collision detection and optimized for minimal updates.  
- Advanced **map validation algorithms** including flood‑fill to ensure maps are fully enclosed and valid before gameplay begins.  
- A modular **engine API** that simplifies rendering, entity management, input handling, and feature integration—enabling easier expansion and maintenance.  

**Controls**  
W / S → Move forward / backward  
A / D → Strafe left / right  
← / → → Rotate view  
ESC → Exit game  
Mouse → Interact with the menu

**Tools & Libraries**  
Written in C, rendered with MiniLibX, video capabilities via libav/avcodec, secure URL support via OpenSSL, and optimization achieved through native time and math libraries.  

**Build & Run Instructions**

Performance Highlights

    Selective redraw logic to only update changed scene segments.

    Distance reuse across raycasts to reduce redundant computation.

    Angle correction for accurate perspective rendering.

    Custom video playback smoothly integrated with game flow.

    Algorithmic door logic and map flood‑fill validation to enhance robustness and performance.
