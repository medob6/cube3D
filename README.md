# 🎮 Cub3D – Beyond the Raycasting Limit

> *A high-performance 3D raycasting engine that pushes the boundaries of what's possible in C*

---

## 🌟 Overview

**Cub3D** is a fully optimized 3D raycasting game engine developed as part of the **42 / 1337 School** curriculum. What began as a challenge to replicate *Wolfenstein 3D* evolved into a sophisticated, modular engine featuring mouse-controlled views, dynamic menus, portals, and in-engine video playback.

### Vision

Build a **performant, expandable, and cleanly engineered system** that maximizes every frame within constrained tools while delivering an immersive visual experience.

---

## ⚙️ Core Design Philosophy

Our approach is built on four pillars:

**Performance First** — Every pixel and ray calculation is meticulously optimized for maximum speed

**Mathematical Precision** — From wall collisions to door mechanics, every motion is computed with accuracy, never approximated

**Engine Modularity** — Clean architecture enables seamless integration of advanced features like portals, video playback, and UI systems

**Immersive Experience** — GTA-style minimap, animated doors, cinematic intros, and responsive controls create a modern gaming feel

## 🎯 Mandatory Part – Core Engine

The foundation of Cub3D includes:

- **🧭 DDA Raycasting** — Precise wall collision detection and texture mapping
- **⚡ Optimized Rendering** — Selective redraws targeting only changed regions (sky, floor, walls)
- **🧩 Smart Map Parsing** — Automatic validation, space padding, and comprehensive boundary checks
- **🧮 Advanced Corrections** — Fisheye distortion removal and distance computation reuse
- **🗺️ Interactive Minimap** — GTA-inspired real-time player tracking with directional display
